## 🛠️ **Development**
This game was built using Unity and the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) to deliver crisp visuals and efficient performance. The main challenge was creating an engaging survival mechanic with smooth platform movement, rising obstacles, and responsive controls.

**Core Scripts:**
- **PlayerController.cs**: Manages player movement, jumps, and collision detection with platforms.
- **PlatformTrigger.cs**: Detects when the player lands on a platform and triggers necessary actions.
- **CameraFollower.cs**: Ensures the camera follows the player seamlessly while adjusting the offset based on the player's position.
- **SnowEffectController.cs**: Controls snow particle effects in the background, ensuring they follow the player’s movement for added immersion.

## 🌋 **The Lava Mechanic**
One of the most exciting features is the **Lava Mechanic**. As the game progresses, lava rises from the bottom of the screen. Touching the lava will despawn platforms and kill the player. This mechanic adds urgency and forces you to keep climbing and jumping.

## 💡 **What’s Next?**
We have many exciting features planned for future updates:
- **Power-ups**: Gain temporary boosts like high jumps, invincibility, and slow-motion.
- **New Obstacles**: Introducing flying enemies and breakable platforms to increase the challenge.
- **Leaderboard**: Compete with friends and players worldwide to see who can survive the longest!
